# Ye Olde Fake 5e Shop

I thought up the idea for this site as a final project during my class at TrueCoders.

As a player of Dungeons & Dragons, I noticed that people had taken the equipment information from WotC's 5e SRD and listed that info in various places and formats
(wikis, APIs, etc.), but I thought it would be a novel idea to present the equipment lists in the form of an eCommerce site, where the user could click on items and a 
shopping cart would tally up the gold/silver/copper in the same way a real eShop would show your total dollars.

And thus, this site was born. Its main purpose is to showcase some of my growing knowledge and skill with C#, ASP.NET and MVC.

I just hope is that at least one person has as much fun using it as I had making it.
